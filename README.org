A handle for major-mode generic functions.

* Value Proposition
=handle= provides generic functions that specialize on major modes and
intended purpose instead of arguments. Similar functionality is needed
across programming languages such as:

- evaluating expressions
- starting repls
- finding documentation
- going to definition
- formatting code
- compiling code
- listing errors

But this functionality is performed by different callables across
major modes and often by multiple callables in the same one. =handle=
groups them together so that they can be bound to a single global
=kbd=, selected based on major mode, and run in sequence until one
succeeds.

* Usage
=handle= generates =handle-*= functions based on (user-specified)
=handle-keywords= that can then be bound to a single global =kbd=
and used in any major mode.

So by running this:
#+begin_src emacs-lisp
  (handle '(python-mode inferior-python-mode)
            :repls #'run-python
            :formatters #'lsp-format-buffer
            :docs '(lsp-describe-thing-at-point
                    python-help-for-region-or-symbol
                    python-eldoc-for-region-or-symbol
                    python-shell-print-region-or-symbol))
#+end_src

And then calling =handle-docs= in python mode, =handle= will run each
of the functions specified under =:docs= in order untill one
succeeds. If a function errors out (or returns =nil=, see
=handle-nice-functions=) it will calmly proceed to the next one. The
same function will behave differently in other modes.

=handle= is also aware of the Emacs mode hierarchy. If it cannot
handle the task you gave it in a specific mode, it will attempt to do
so with the instructions you gave for the parent mode. This also means
that you can set default/global handlers by targeting modes like
=prog-mode= and =text-mode=.

* Note
This package is designed to be as unopinionated as possible. I
strongly recommend setting your own =handle-keywords= /before/ loading
the package. The appropriate =handle-*= functions will then be
generated, and the =handle= function itself will be able to interpret
all of them.
