A handle for things.

=handle= provides handlers for functions frequently shared accros
major modes, and often performend by multiple callables in the same
one (major mode) such as:

- evaluating expressions
- starting repls
- finding documentation
- going to definition
- formatting code
- compiling code
- lisiting errors

=handle= generates =handle-*= functions based on (user-specified)
=handle-keywords= that can then be bound to a single global =kbd=
and used in any major mode.

So by running this:
#+begin_src emacs-lisp
  (handle '(python-mode inferior-python-mode)
            :repls #'run-python
            :formaters #'lsp-format-buffer
            :docs '(lsp-describe-thing-at-point
                    python-help-for-region-or-symbol
                    python-eldoc-for-region-or-symbol
                    python-shell-print-region-or-symbol))
#+end_src

And then calling =handle-docs= in python mode, =handle= will run each
of the functions specified under =:docs= in order untill one
succeeds. If a function errors out or returns =nil= it will calmly
proceed to the next one. The same function will behave differently in
other modes.
